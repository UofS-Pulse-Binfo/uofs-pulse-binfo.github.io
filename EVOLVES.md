In 2015, we embarked upon an ambitious genomics project [Application of Genomic Innovation in the Lentil Economy (AGILE)](https://knowpulse.usask.ca/AGILE) that has delivered the first genome long-read assembly for CDC Redberry (genus Lens), assemblies for 2 wild lentil species, and molecular markers for seed color. This was a start to improving the efficiency at which lentil breeders can produce seeds with select traits, allowing a precision in lentil breeding not yet seen before. Building on these genomic gains, we launched **Enhancing the Value of Lentil Variation for Ecosystem Survival (EVOLVES)** in 2019 to further breeding efficiencies and focus on characterizing the nutritional qualities and functionalities of lentil. In this 4 year project, we will further develop and explore the Lens genome linking a wider variety of candidate genes to visual and nutritional quality traits, allowing breeders to produce seeds that fit into very specific end-product categories with a focus on the value-added market.
